\frametitle{Gitlab: Continuous Integration (CI)}

\begin{block}{From wikipedia}
\textit{CI is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day}
\end{block}

And it should fulfill the following premises:

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Mantain a code repository
\item Automate the build
\item Make the build self-tested
\item Everyone commits everyday to their baseline
\item \textbf{Every commit should be built}
\item Keep the build fast
\item Cloned production environment
\item Get the latest deliverables

\end{itemize}
