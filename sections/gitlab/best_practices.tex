\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Set production branches as protected branches (like master). No one push, Only mantainers merge
\item Create an issue for each task/feature/bug. Use templates for creating issues
\item Create a README.md in the root repository which should include installation and usage of your software
\item Don't add the files generated by your IDE to the git version control
\item Test first (TDD)
\item Write commit messages saying why not what
\item Tag versions
\end{itemize}
